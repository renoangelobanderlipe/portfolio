  body: "Hello there! My name is Reno Angelo Banderlipe, I enjoy creating things on the Web also on Mobile. My interest in programming started back in 2019 when I got introduced to Java and OOP but curiosity hits me back in 2020 when I created a backdoor script that allows unauthorized user to execute code to the victimâ€™s computer and that started my interest to learn other programming languages. 
  
  My interest in Web Development started during my Internship at PC4ME and It was first introduced to us by their Senior Developer and that time I never had any background in those technologies but I slowly learn and adapt to them despite I am still in the progress of developing my Capstone Project(Mobile Application) which uses other technologies as well."
